                        </a> for a complete list of dates. Kindergarten students will begin running the first week in November. Running Club is brought to you through the compassion of our Morning Creek PTA. Our new shoe tag system was funded by the generosity of the Morning Creek Foundation! This new system will save valuable time for teachers and volunteers so they can focus on the education and safety of your children. We ask that each student and parent review and sign the running club rules sheet that will be provided. This will help the students understand the expectations and allow them to earn the incentives provided by running club. We encourage the Morning Creek Character Pillars. Morning Creek is part of the No Excuses University. These guidelines apply at Running Club as well as on the school campus.

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">All confirmed positive COVID-19 incidents related to Poway Unified school sites and offices will be posted to this page. For the purposes of this dashboard, PUSD is distinguishing between school-based cases and community-based cases. Starting in December, we will have two separate columns for every month in the table below:

"S.B." School-Based cases: 
​a. school-based cases will potentially impact individuals' health and wellness at our school or office because there may be site-related exposure OR a positive case was on campus during an infectious period
b. a school-based case MAY cause classroom closure or other precatuionary measures
c. we will follow the San Diego County Office of Eduction Decision Tree and Guidelines around isolating and notifying close contacts, as needed
 
Known "C.B." Community-Based cases:
a. community-based cases DO NOT impact individuals' health and wellness at our school or office because no one at the site was in close contact with the positive individual during the infectious period. Per the CDC definition, this means no one at the site was within 6 feet of the infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to test specimen collection) until the time the patient was isolated
b. this dashboard will include all known community-based cases related to PUSD; this dashboard may not reflect all community-based cases involving our staff and students because PUSD relies on notification from public health or self-reporting from staff or families
c. we will follow the San Diego County Office of Education Decision Tree and Guidelines around isolating the positive case, as needed
 
The Dashboard is updated at least once a week and when we are notified of confirmed cases.

*Important Note: PUSD does not wait to notify close contacts upon initial report of a positive case. However, we do wait for official confirmation from the public health department before listing the case on this dashboard. This could result in a delay of cases appearing on this dashboard or a discrepancy between the number of notifications received and actual number of confirmed cases (when the case is not confirmed positive by public health).
